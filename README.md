The To-Do List App is a simple yet efficient task management application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks with ease. The app provides an intuitive user interface for adding, marking, and deleting tasks dynamically without requiring a page refresh.

Features
✅ Add Tasks – Users can input tasks and add them to the list dynamically.
✅ Mark Tasks as Completed – Tasks can be marked as done, visually differentiating them from pending ones.
✅ Delete Tasks – Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
✅ Local Storage Support – Tasks persist even after refreshing the page, ensuring data is not lost.
✅ Responsive Design – Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML – Structure of the app
CSS – Styling for an attractive and user-friendly design
JavaScript – Handles task creation, updates, and deletion dynamically
Local Storage – Saves tasks for future access
How It Works
The user types a task into an input field and clicks the "Add" button.
The task appears in a list with options to mark as completed or delete it.
Completed tasks get a strikethrough effect to indicate they are done.
Tasks remain saved in local storage even after reloading the page.
